# Azure - Exposed Azure AD to Bitbucket through OAuth

Ensured that I had the `Demo AD` Tenant active (next to my name in the corner)

Opened the **Azure Active Directory** service inside the Azure Portal

Clicked **App Registrations**, then **New Registration**

Defined a new App Registration with the following settings:

* **Name**: `Demo Bitbucket App`
* **Supported account types**: `Accounts in this organizational directory only (Default Directory only - Single tenant)`
* **Redirect URI (optional)**: (blank)
